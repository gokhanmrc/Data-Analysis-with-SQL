# PostgreSQL Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal notes, queries, and exercises as I learn and practice PostgreSQL.  
It includes SQL scripts covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Database creation and schema design
- Basic and advanced SQL queries
- Joins, subqueries, and window functions
- Indexing and performance tuning
- Real-world data analysis examples

## Folder Structure (to be updated)

- `01_Basics/` â€” Introductory SQL commands and table creation
- `02_Intermediate/` â€” Joins, aggregations, and filtering
- `03_Projects/` â€” Small analysis projects using sample databases
- `Notes/` â€” Markdown files with summarized concepts and tips

## Tools

- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin (or DBeaver)
- Sample datasets (e.g., DVD Rental, Titanic, etc.)

## Goal

To build a strong foundation in PostgreSQL for data analysis, reporting, and backend database management.
